        <p class="p">The smash burger is an American staple that dates back to the early 20th century that is
            still a common feature of diners across the United States. What makes a smash burger
            different from other hamburgers is that the patty begins as a meatball which is smashed
            into a thin patty on a hot flat-top grill. There are a few variations on this method of
            making a burger like grilling it in mustard or smashing onions into the burger, but this
            recipe will cover just the classic smash burger.</p>
