	<h1>Digital Literacy Narrative</h1>
<h3>Gabriel Fink</h3>
<p>Over the course of this semester, I have worked on improving my digital literacy quite a bit. From learning basic HTML and CSS, to working with DITA XML and Oxygen, and even helping develop the website for the local Austin Healy Club, this semester has been quite the journey. Working in seclusion because of the pandemic has also been an interesting experience. Google was a fabulous resource throughout as well as the many resources from WRIT 4662W. It was a very self-directed process, which I am fortunately familiar with. </p>
	<p>My main goals for improving my digital literacy over this semester were to familiarize myself with a variety of digital production programs including Dreamweaver, Illustrator, Oxygen XML Editor, and Rhino 3D; I also wanted to improve my ability to create documents with more creative and technically complex processes. I will mainly focus on the production of documents, but I improved my skills with visual digital media quite a bit over this semester.</p>
	<p>Working with these programs and learning the syntax to build websites on a regular basis throughout the semester was the main approach I took to accomplishing my goal. Like I said, Google was a great guide in all my projects. WC3 Schools was another fantastic resource for learning syntax for HTML and CSS in an easy to understand way. For Oxygen XML and DITA, YouTube and the class resources in WRIT 4662W were incredibly helpful for getting me started. From there, it took quite a bit of personal experimentation with Oxygen to figure out how to turn my DITA XML into actual documents. Another great learning resource this semester was my peers, who I would like to thank for being so helpful and responsive despite our remote learning circumstances. Working with them on the Minnesota Austin Healy Club was a fun challenge.</p>
	<p>Learning to make documents with programs other than Microsoft Word is something I wanted to do for a long time. Taking the time to learn code like HTML, CSS, and XML was a fun, yet frustrating learning experience. I am happy with how my projects turned out and I would like to share a couple of them and my process for creating them.</p>
