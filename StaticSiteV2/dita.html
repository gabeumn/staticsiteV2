	<h1>Using Oxygen XML Editor to Create a Recipe</h1>
	<h4><a href="index.html">Back</a></h4>
	<p>Working with DITA XML and Oxygen XML Editor was an eye-opening experience. DITA XML was a completely new concept to me so this was a project with a lot of trial and error. For this project, I used a recipe because I thought it would be a good starting point for someone without any prior experience in DITA XML. The recipe I went with was for smash burgers because it is one of my favorite recipes and it is relatively simple. I decided to transform my DITA XML into a PDF file and HTML which was the most difficult part of the process.</p>
	<p>What I had the most trouble with was the appearance of my transformed PDF file. My PDF file was coming out with chapter headings and a table of contents for each section of the recipe like it was an eBook. Clearly, that was not the format for a recipe on the web. Google, as always, was where I turned first to find a solution to my problem, but many of the resources and help forums I came across suggested building my own transformation plug-in from the ground up. Since I had just started with XML, I was not keen on that solution. After a bit more research and troubleshooting, I finally got my PDF to a point that I was happy with. I had less difficulty with my HTML5 file, but this was probably because after so much frustration with the PDF, I knew where to look to configure that file properly.</p>
	<p>I want to learn more about Oxygen and DITA XML. Despite my initial difficulties, this is a powerful tool for creating a wide variety of documents like eBooks and entire websites. The ability to split documents into topics also makes this an incredible tool for working in a team. I think it would have been interesting to use Oxygen on the Austin Healy client project, but I understand that it may have been difficult for beginners like me to put out content that matched the quality of what our class produced. I have linked my transformed documents below for your viewing pleasure.</p>
